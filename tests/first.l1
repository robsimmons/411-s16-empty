//test return 1

// The tests you write for 15-411 will all go in this directory. The
// tests we write will all be provided to you through the public course
// repository in the directory ../../tests.

// The first line in this file means that the testing harness will 
// expect this to be a file that compiles and returns 1. 

// This isn't the case! There's no code in this file, so it will
// fail to compile (this is indicatied by writing 'test error'
// instead). 

// Read the handout and look at the files in ../../tests/lab1-basic
// for more information.

// You should turn this file into a working test. You are welcome to 
// write some more tests.
